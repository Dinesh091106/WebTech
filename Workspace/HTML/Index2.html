  <h3>Data literals:</h3>  
  typeof: <br>
    it is a special operator in javascript <br>
    it is a unary operator(will workon only one operator) <br>
    typeof-will check the datatype of an operand
    <h3>String:</h3>
    set of character or single character consider as string in javascript <br>
    String can be declared in three ways they are <br>
    1.single quotes <br>
    2.double quotes <br>
    3.backticks
    <h4>Advantage of using backticks:</h4>
    no need to use +(concate) operator for concatination <br>
    no need to to use regular expression to go the next line <br>
    if you want to give the space betwwen two numbers just give the space using ${} and go to the next line just click the the enter button
    <h3>Number:</h3>
    number are cosidered as number in javascript <br>
    we don't have any datatypes in number but we have some range in numbers(2^53-1) to -(2^53-1) <br>
    <h3>Bigint:</h3>
    cosidered as number datatype. <br>
    when the range is getting exceeded we have to use bigint <br>
    bigint stands for biginteger <br>
    suffix of the number we have to use n <br>
    should not mix number and bigint <br>
    <h3>Boolean:</h3>
    true and false keyword in javascript is considered as boolean datatypes <br>
    mostly we will get boolean on conditional based operations
    <h3>Null:</h3>
    it is a keyword in javascript <br>
    it has value in javascript <br>
    when the absence the data we will be using the value called null <br>
    typeof null nothing but object <br>
    typeof typeof null is string
    <h3>Undefined:</h3>
    it is a keyword in javascript <br>
    it has a value <br>
    when a variable declared in javascript,javascript engine implicity assign a value called undefined
    <h3>Not defined:</h3>
    when a variable is not declared in javascript it is called as not defined
    <h3>Non primitive</h3>
    developer creating object
    <h4>Object</h4>
    any entity which is existing in the real world considered as object <br>
    object will have state and behaviour <br>
    state-what object can have <br>
    behaviour-what object can do <br>
    both state and behaviour considered as property in javascript <br>
    property will be in the form of key and values <br>
    javascript object nothing but collectioned of key value pairs
    <h3>How to access object member</h3>
    objectref.member/objectref.memberfunction() 
    <h3>Variable</h3>
    named block of memory   <br>
    to store the data/values <br>
    there are three variables in javascript are <br> 1.var, <br>2.let, <br>3.const <br>
    javascript is an dynamically typed language hence we can able to change the datatype during runtime of the execution <br>
    javascript also called as weakly typed language <br>
    hence declaring variable is mandatory <br>
    declaring datatype is not mandatory
    <h3>Characteristics of var,let and const</h3>
    1.variable declaration <br>
    2.scope <br>
    3.hoisting <br>
    4.temporal dead zone
    <h3>Variable declaration</h3>
    <h4>var</h4>
    var a;//Declaration <br>
    a=10;//initialization <br>
    a=80;//re-initialization <br>
    var a=90;//re-declaration & re-initialization <br>
    var b=80;//declaration & initialization <br>
    <h4>let</h4>
    let love;//declaration <br>
    love='priya';//intialization <br>
    love='sharmila';//re-initialization <br>
    let love='priya';//re-declaration is not possible re-initialization is not possible <br>
    let love2='marriage'//declaration & intialization
    <h4>const</h4>
    const loved='marriage';//declaration & initialization <br>
    re-declaration & re-initialization both are not possible
    <h4>type coersion(process of converting one datatype to another datatype)</h4>
    classified into two types <br>
    1.implicit type coersion <br>
    2.explicit type coersion <br>
    <h4>implicit type coersion</h4>
    implicit type coercion-the process of converting one datatype to another datatype by javascript engine when the wrong datatype enter by developer or user nothing but implicit type coercion
    <h4>NaN stands for not a number</h4>
    when we are trying toconvert string into number as result we will get NaN(not a number) <br>
    typeof NaN is number <br>
    isNaN("35a")not a number//true <br>
    is NaN("35")not not a number(or)number//false
    <h4>explicit type coercion</h4>
    the process of converting one datatype into another datatype by javascript developer
    <h4>scope</h4>
    there are three kind of scope-global,local,lexical <br>
    global-highest visibility of the member-var
    local-visibility only inside the block-let/const <br>
    lexical-the ability of javascript engine search for a member inside the block,if member is not present it will go for global
    <h4>Hoisting</h4>
    calling a variable before declaration is known as hoisting
    <h4>Temporal dead zone</h4>
    time gap between declaration and initialization <br>
    let and const:declare and use it
